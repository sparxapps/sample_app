ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From library_project:
* AndroidManifest.xml
* library_project.iml
* proguard-project.txt
From sample_app:
* proguard-project.txt
* sample_app.iml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In library_project:
* src\ => library_project\src\main\java\
In sample_app:
* -test\res\ => sample_app\src\androidTest\res\
* -test\src\ => sample_app\src\androidTest\java\
* AndroidManifest.xml => sample_app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* res\ => sample_app\src\main\res\
* src\ => sample_app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
